        Rules:
        - Do not use any information outside of what is explicitly provided.
        - Do not make assumptions or generate content that is not grounded in the input.
        - If critical information is missing or ambiguous, respond with:  
        "The provided information is insufficient to respond accurately."
        - Quote content directly from the email or attachments where appropriate.
        - First, show your reasoning step-by-step.
        - Then write the final response to the email.

        EMAIL BODY:

        ATTACHMENTS:

        ...

        ---

        REASONING:
        1. Identify the main intent or request in the email.
        2. Locate supporting facts in the attachments.
        3. Ensure all facts used are quoted or referenced directly from the content.
        4. If you can answer based on available facts, continue. If not, stop and return the "insufficient info" message.
